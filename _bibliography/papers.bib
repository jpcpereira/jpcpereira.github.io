  title={Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Energy Time Series Data Using Variational Recurrent Autoencoders with Attention},
  author={Pereira, João and Silveira, Margarida},
  abstract={In y of predicting it with certaintyrs, the knowledge of one prection in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
