I am a Senior Data Scientist at adidas in the Global Digital Data Science team in Amsterdam where I am Tech Lead of two demand forecasting products. Prior to joining adidas, I completed my Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Data Science at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I worked on projects for companies like ASML (2x), Van Lanschot, TE Connectivity, Heijmans, and FIOD. Before the EngD, I conducted deep learning research  on anomaly detection in time series data and completed my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico (Portugal). Meanwhile, I was lucky to have spent a semester at Université Catholique de Louvain (Belgium).
I am broadly interested in the field of machine learning and its endless applications and passionate about turning cutting-edge research into products.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, meeting friends, traveling, and cooking new dishes.

Feel free to reach out to me with any queries!
