I am a Data Science Lead & Senior Data Scientist at adidas where I work on building machine learning products that automate content creation using language and vision models. Previously, I was the Technical Lead of the demand forecasting products for adidas' eCom channels. Prior to joining adidas, I completed my Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Data Science at Eindhoven University of Technology and before that I conducted deep learning research on anomaly detection in time series data and completed my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico (Portugal). I am broadly interested in the field of machine learning and its endless applications and passionate about turning cutting-edge research into highly impactful products.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, meeting friends, traveling, and cooking new dishes.

Feel free to reach out to me with any queries!
