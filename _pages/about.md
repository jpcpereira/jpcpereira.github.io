I'm a Data Science Lead at adidas where I build GenAI-based solutions that enable better product discovery and deliver personalized experiences to millions of users across adidas.com and App.

Enjoy creating scalable machine learning products in the cloud. Love building a culture of innovation, technical excellence, and where people feel empowered to be the best version of themselves. Passionate about turning cutting-edge AI into impactful products that improve customer experiences.

Outside of work, I enjoy working out, travelling, and writing blog posts about the latest trends in AI.
