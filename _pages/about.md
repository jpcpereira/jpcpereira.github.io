I am a Data Scientist at adidas in the Digital Data Science team in Amsterdam where I work on developing and productionizing demand forecasting models. Prior to joining adidas, I completed my Engineering Doctorate (EngD) in Data Science at Eindhoven University of Technology, where I worked on data science projects for multiple companies (ASML, Van Lanschot, TE Connectivity, Heijmans, FIOD). Before the EngD, I conducted deep learning research focusing on anomaly detection in time series data and completed my Master's and Bachelor's degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering. I am broadly interested in the field of machine learning and its endless applications and passionate about turning cutting-edge research into products. Feel free to contact me!
