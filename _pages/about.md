I'm a Data Science Lead at adidas where I build and scale machine learning solutions powered by multimodal LLMs that improve product discoverability and deliver personalized shopping experiences to millions of users across adidas .com and App.
Previously, I was Technical Lead for our demand forecasting products that enable better buying, planning, and trading decisions throughout adidas’ eCom.
Before joining adidas, I obtained my Engineering Doctorate degree in Data Science from Eindhoven University of Technology and conducted deep learning research on time-series anomaly detection back in Lisbon at IST.
I'm deeply interested in machine learning and generative AI and enjoy turning cutting-edge AI research into highly impactful products that improve consumer experiences and unlock business potential.

Outside of work, I enjoy working out, travelling, or writing blog posts about the latest trends in AI.
