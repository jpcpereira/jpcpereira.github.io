I work at adidas where I build scalable machine learning solutions in the cloud that enable better product discovery and deliver personalized experiences to millions of users across adidas.com and App.
My passion lies in building a culture of innovation, technical excellence, and where people feel empowered to be the best version of themselves.
Most of the time, my focus is on transforming cutting-edge AI technologies into impactful products that elevate customer experiences and drive business growth.

Outside of work, I'm a fitness enthusiast, avid traveller, and a blogger.
