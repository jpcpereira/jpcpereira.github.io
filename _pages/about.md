I am a Data Science Lead at adidas where I develop machine learning solutions in the Content Intelligence space that provide better experiences to millions of users across adidas .com and App. Previously, I was Tech Lead for demand forecasting products that enable better buying, planning, and product trading for adidas’ eCom. Prior to joining adidas, I obtained my Engineering Doctorate Degree in Data Science from Eindhoven University of Technology and before that I conducted applied deep learning research on time-series anomaly detection.
I am passionate about machine learning and generative AI and enjoy turning cutting-edge research into highly impactful products.

In my free time, I enjoy working out, writing blog posts, and travelling.
