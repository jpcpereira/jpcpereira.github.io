    - title: Lab Monitor
      institution: Lisbon Machine Learning School (LxMLS) | Lisbon, Portugal
      year: Jan 2019 - Jul 2019
      description:
          - Part of the organizing team of LxMLS'19 as a monitor. 
          - Had responsibilities in the organization of the school and helped the students solving the exercises during the lab sessions, implementing machine learning algorithms such as hidden Markov models, conditional random fields, recurrent neural networks, and reinforcement learning. 


    - title: Student Researcher
      institution: Institute for Systems and Robotics | Lisbon, Portugal
      year: Jan 2018 - Dec 2018
      description:
          - Within the Signal and Image Processing group of ISR my research focused on deep learning and anomaly detection in time series data.
          - Proposed an approach for time series anomaly detection based on variational autoencoders, recurrent neural networks, and attention mechanisms. This approach is unsupervised, making it suitable for applications where obtaining labels is expensive or time-consuming (fraud detection, medical diagnosis, fault detection, ...).
